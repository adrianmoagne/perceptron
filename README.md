A single layer perceptron algorithm that classifies an RGB input color as one of the 8 colors it recognizes.

The output layer contains 8 neurons. Each one represents a color. 

When a user select one color to be classified, this value is normalized and the algorithm applies it to its neurons. Whose linear function returns the highest value is the color recognized by the perceptron.

The training input colors are normilized values of RGB which range is [-1,1]

The outputs used to learn the colors are values which can be either 1 or -1. 1 represents positive to that color and -1 negative.
