# Perceptron
## Description
A single layer perceptron algorithm that classify an RGB input color as one of the 8 colors its recognize.

The training input colors are normilized values of RGB which range is [-1,1]

The outputs used to learn the colors are values which can be either 1 or -1. 1 represents positivy to that color and -1 negative.

When a user picks a color, this value is normalized and whose linear function returns the highest value is the color recognized by the perceptron.
